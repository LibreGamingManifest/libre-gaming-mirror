# libre-gaming-mirror
Libre Gaming reference documents mirrored.

Games come and go, code, servers, design documents, art assets get abandoned.
We are  not able to host all the past and present open source games. It is also not out purpose.

We want to mirror reference documents for notable game designs or fictional game universe lore documents so that they may remain accessible in case of the original hosting becoming inaccessible or just to have a basic library readily at hand.

Structure of the repository
- lore-documents: stores universe lore
- game-design: game design documents

We may restructure the repository in the future to improve organization of documents.

In some cases we may just add a link reference here for later mirroring:
- the link list is currently empty
